description: Publish a changelog post to updates.page with the `updates` CLI. Use when the user has just shipped, released or tagged something and wants it announced, asks for release notes or a changelog entry, or mentions updates.page, the `updates` command, or their public changelog.

# Publishing to updates.page

A changelog post is **public, on the user's own domain, under their brand**.
Treat publishing the way you would treat a deploy, not the way you would
treat a commit.

## Show the text before you send anything

Write the post and **show it in your reply first**. Do not run a command yet.
"Write me release notes" is a request for words, and this skill fires on that
phrasing whether or not updates.page was mentioned — creating a draft in
someone's account at that point is a change to their data they did not ask
for.

Once they want it saved, or once they have made clear from the start that it
is going to updates.page ("draft this on updates.page", "add it to the
changelog"), save it:

```bash
updates draft --title "…" --content "<p>…</p>" --json
```

Then tell them how to publish it: `updates publish <id>`.

## Publish only when asked

Publishing is a separate decision from saving. Unless the user has clearly
asked for it — "publish it", "announce it", "ship the changelog" — stop at
the draft. A changelog post is public the moment you publish it.

If you have been asked to publish but are unsure whether the change is ready
to be public, `--private` publishes without putting it on the public
changelog.

Never publish a post the user has not seen the text of.

## Signing in

```bash
updates whoami --json     # already signed in? this says who
updates login             # opens a browser; falls back to a code to type
```

`updates login` needs a human. It prints a URL and a short code — **show
them the URL** rather than describing it, and wait. On a machine with no
browser it detects that and switches to the code-entry flow by itself.

Unattended (CI, a container), the token comes from the environment instead;
never pass one as a command-line argument, where it lands in shell history
and the process list:

```bash
UPDATESPAGE_TOKEN=… updates list --json
```

## The loop

```bash
updates categories --json                     # ids to file the post under
updates draft --title "Dark mode" \
  --content "<p>Switch to dark mode from your profile menu.</p>" \
  --category-id 4 --json
```

Every command takes `--json`, which puts structured data on stdout and
nothing else — progress, warnings and prompts go to stderr. Parse the JSON;
do not scrape the human-readable output.

Other flags worth knowing: `--summary` (feeds and embeds), `--cover-image
<path>`, `--at <ISO 8601>` to schedule. `updates <command> --help` has the
rest.

`--url` points the changelog entry at an external page — a blog post, a
release on GitHub — instead of opening the entry itself. It does **not**
replace the body: `--title` and `--content` are required either way, and
omitting them exits `2`. Write the post as normal and add `--url` on top.

## Writing the post

You are writing for the user's customers, not for their git log.

- **Title is a headline.** "Dark mode" — not `feat(ui): add dark mode toggle (#1421)`.
- **Say what someone can now do**, not which files changed.
- **One post per shipped change**, not one per commit. Several commits that
  add one feature are one post.
- **Not everything ships to a changelog.** Internal refactors, dependency
  bumps, CI fixes and test changes do not belong on a customer-facing page.
  If a release contains only those, say so instead of inventing a post.
- **Don't invent detail.** If you cannot tell what a change does for a user
  from the diff, ask.

## When something fails

Exit codes are stable and mean one thing each. Branch on them, and on
`error.code` in the JSON — not on message text.

| Code | Meaning | What to do |
|---:|---|---|
| `0` | Success | — |
| `1` | No more specific code applied | Read the message; do not retry blindly |
| `2` | Usage — bad flag or argument | Fix the command; do not retry it unchanged |
| `3` | Configuration problem | Run `updates doctor` |
| `4` | Not signed in, or the token was refused | Run `updates login` — but see below |
| `5` | Network or server error | Retry with backoff |
| `6` | No such post/category | Re-read ids with `list` / `categories` |
| `7` | Exists, but is in the wrong state (409/422) | Fix the state or the fields; retrying unchanged will fail again |
| `130` | Cancelled | Stop |

**`7` is the one to read carefully.** It covers validation failures as well as
state conflicts — publishing a post that is already live, or sending a field
the API rejects. Both mean *change something*, not *try again*.

**`4` does not always mean "sign in again".** A token that is refused because
the account may not use the API surfaces here too. If `updates login` has
already succeeded, do not loop on it — say what happened and stop.

Under `--json` a failure is JSON on stdout too:

```json
{ "ok": false, "error": { "code": "auth.not_signed_in", "message": "…", "hint": "Run `updates login`." } }
```

**A `403` means this account may not use the API right now** — its plan or
trial does not cover it. Only the account owner can change that. Tell the
user and stop; retrying will not help.

## Calling the API directly

The CLI wraps an ordinary REST API. If you would rather call it yourself,
the specification is at `https://app.updates.page/api/openapi.json` and
authentication is `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

Two things the specification cannot tell you, and both bite:

- **Post ids are hashids, not integers.** Round-trip them as strings.
- **Tokens are not scoped.** Every token carries its approver's full API
  access. A key marked `machine` is limited to posts, categories, uploads
  and imports — ask for one of those if a human is choosing on your behalf.

## Reading someone else's changelog

Every hosted changelog serves RSS at `/rss` and JSON at
`/api/portal/announcements` on its own domain, with no credential. That is
the cheapest way to find out what a product shipped.
